When we sum daily CFS values across a year, we're no longer dealing with a rate but with a volume of water that has passed through the stream over time. This is why hydrologists use \"CFS-days\" as the unit - it accurately represents the integration of flow rate (CFS) over a time period (days). One CFS-day equals 86,400 cubic feet of water, which is the volume of water flowing at a rate of 1 cubic foot per second for an entire day. Using \"summed CFS\" would be dimensionally incorrect because summing rates doesn't maintain the same units; the time component needs to be accounted for in the final measurement."

    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Scientific research rarely yields a simple and straightforward right answer. Instead, scientists analyze evidence, compare it to known physical processes, and make informed recommendations based on data and statistics. As you learned in *Machine Learning Foundations in the Earth System Sciences*, machine learning is not an exact science, rather, it generates approximations from large datasets. This makes evaluating model quality complex. What one scientist considers a high-performing model may be insufficient to another. What matters most is your ability to justify your results within the context of physical science and the real-world stakes. As you continue your studies, remember that these models are not just numbers. They are representations of the physical world."
