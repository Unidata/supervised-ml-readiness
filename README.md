# Machine Learning in the Earth Systems Sciences

This learning series is designed to guide you through the very basics of supervised machine learning in the Earth Systems Sciences. You will discover how machine learning is used by scientists, the process for supervised machine learning model development, how data plays a crucial role in making good predictions, and how to be an effective and ethical user of machine learning tools. You will also learn that machine learning is not a catch-all solution to every problem! 

You won't be expected to have any programming skills to complete this learnign series. Through simple schematics and graphs, you will be guided through the conceptual process for developing and using supervised machine learning for science. Expect to finish the series with the skills to assess the suitability of supervised machine learning for new problems and question supervised machine learning analyses you encounter.

This learning series consists of three modules, each building upon the previous:

2. Machine Learning Applications in the Earth Systems Sciences
3. Machine Learning Analysis in the Earth Systems Sciences
